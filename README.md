## About
As the CEO of M3 Works, I bring a unique blend of experiences
in software development, mechanical engineering, and scientific
modeling. My career trajectory started with utilizing computational
fluid dynamics for wind power estimation in mountainous terrains,
before pivoting to snow hydrology at the USDA Agricultural Research Service.
During this period, I was the primary developer for the Automated Water Supply Model
(AWSM), a critical framework now employed by M3 Works. Before spearheading M3 Works,
I honed my skills managing data pipelines in the cloud as a software developer
in the commercial sector. Today, I lead cloud infrastructure coordination at M3 Works,
and continually innovate strategies for monitoring and maintaining our real-time
snowpack estimation efforts across the Western US. Beyond my professional commitments,
I am an active contributor to open source Python repositories,
and relish in the simple pleasures of gardening and cycling.
