## About
I am an engineer, scientific modeler, and CEO of M3 Works.
I have a unique blend of experiences
in software development, mechanical engineering, and scientific
modeling. My career trajectory started with utilizing computational
fluid dynamics for wind power estimation in mountainous terrains,
before pivoting to snow hydrology at the USDA Agricultural Research Service.
During this period, I was the primary developer for the Automated Water Supply Model
(AWSM), which serves as a framework for the trusted snowpack model iSnobal.
This framework is a critical piece of operational modeling at M3 Works.
Before co-founding M3 Works, I honed my skills managing data pipelines in the
cloud as a software developer in the commercial sector.
Today, I lead cloud infrastructure coordination at M3 Works,
and continually innovate strategies for monitoring, maintaining, and visualizing
our real-time snowpack estimation efforts across the Western US.
Beyond my professional commitments,
I am an active contributor to open source Python repositories,
and relish in the simple pleasures of gardening and cycling.

## Opensource Projects

### Metloom
[metloom](https://github.com/M3Works/metloom) is a python 
library created with the goal of consistent, simple sampling of 
meteorology and snow related point measurments from a variety of 
datasources across the Western US. Currently, metloom can sample data from
NRCS, CDEC, USGS, and Mesowest, all in a unified format. It is a game changer
for model validation and timeseries analysis and is actively maintained!
Check out the [metloom tutorial](https://github.com/M3Works/metloom-tutorial)
for some example use cases.

### snowexsql
[snowexsql](https://github.com/SnowEx/snowexsql) gives programmatic access
to a wide array of measured snow products from the NASA
[SnowEx](https://snow.nasa.gov/snowex/open-source-tools) campaign.
It was developed to be used during the SnowEx hackweeks, and is still maintained
by M3 Works and utilized by scientists across multiple groups!

### Metevents
[metevents](https://github.com/M3Works/metevents) was developed for easy
identifications of events in timeseries data. It can be used to identify
storms in precipitaton data, gaps in temperature data, or flat-lining that
may indicate a malfunctioning sensor. It can also find erroneous spikes
to aid in filtering of data. It is a powerful and easy to use data helper!

## Data Visualization

Here are a handful of my favorite visualizations created at M3 Works. These
are a team effort and took more than just my skills to make.
If you scroll far enough you'll find my tomato experiment of 2023.
