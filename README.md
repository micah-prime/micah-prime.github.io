## About
I am an engineer, scientific modeler, and CEO of M3 Works.
I have a unique blend of experiences
in software development, mechanical engineering, and scientific
modeling. My career trajectory started with utilizing computational
fluid dynamics for wind power estimation in mountainous terrains,
before pivoting to snow hydrology at the USDA Agricultural Research Service.
During this period, I was the primary developer for the Automated Water Supply Model
(AWSM), a critical framework now employed by M3 Works. Before spearheading M3 Works,
I honed my skills managing data pipelines in the cloud as a software developer
in the commercial sector. Today, I lead cloud infrastructure coordination at M3 Works,
and continually innovate strategies for monitoring and maintaining our real-time
snowpack estimation efforts across the Western US. Beyond my professional commitments,
I am an active contributor to open source Python repositories,
and relish in the simple pleasures of gardening and cycling.

## Opensource Projects

### Metloom
[metloom](https://github.com/M3Works/metloom) is a python 
library created with the goal of consistent, simple sampling of 
meteorology and snow related point measurments from a variety of 
datasources across the Western US. Currently, metloom can sample data from
NRCS, CDEC, USGS, and Mesowest, all in a unified format. It is a game changer
for model validation and timeseries analysis and is actively maintained!
Check out the [metloom tutorial](https://github.com/M3Works/metloom-tutorial)
for some example use cases.

### snowexsql
[snowexsql](https://github.com/SnowEx/snowexsql) gives programmatic access
to a wide array of measured snow products from the NASA SnowEx campaign.
It was developed to be used during the SnowEx hackweeks, and is still maintained
by M3 Works and utilized by scientists across multiple groups!
